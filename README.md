# scalabeling

Scalabelng is a lightweight labeling tool for highly sensitive data which uses a linear slider as the main user interface for user created labels. The system records the user inputs (labels) from this slider and combines them with body sensor data. Finally the resulting labeled dataset is saved and can be used in various machine learning systems.
